# DevDelta Tech - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the DevDelta Tech website to GitHub Pages.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click "New repository" (green button)
   - Repository name: `devdeltatech` (or your preferred name)
   - Make sure it's **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload Your Files**
   - On the new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop ALL files and folders from your project directory
   - Or use "choose your files" to select all files
   - Write a commit message: "Initial commit: DevDelta Tech website"
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository Settings tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section (left sidebar)
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access Your Website**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`
   - It may take 5-10 minutes for the first deployment
   - GitHub will show you the URL in the Pages settings

### Method 2: Using Git Commands

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/devdeltatech

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: DevDelta Tech website"

# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/devdeltatech.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Then follow steps 3-4 from Method 1 to enable GitHub Pages.
